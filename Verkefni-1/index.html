        <p style="color:white;text-align:center;"><i>"Eating a vegan diet could be the single biggest way to reduce your <br>environmental impact on earth, a new study suggests.<br>
            Researchers at the University of Oxford found that cutting meat and <br>dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon<br> footprint from food by up to 73 per cent.<br>
            Meanwhile, if everyone stopped eating these foods, they found that<br> global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area equivalent<br> to the size of the US, China, Australia and the EU combined.<br>     
            Not only would this result in a significant drop in greenhouse gas <br>emissions, it would also free up wild land lost to agriculture, one of the<br> primary causes for mass wildlife extinction."</i></p>
